require 'sinatra/base'

module Sinatra #:nodoc:

  # Normally Sinatra expects that the completion of a request is # determined
  # by the block exiting, and returning a value for the body.
  #
  # In an async environment, we want to tell the webserver that we're not going
  # to provide a response now, but some time in the future.
  #
  # The a* methods provide a method for doing this, by informing the server of
  # our asynchronous intent, and then scheduling our action code (your block)
  # as the next thing to be invoked by the server.
  #
  # This code can then do a number of things, including waiting (asynchronously)
  # for external servers, services, and whatnot to complete. When ready to send
  # the real response, simply setup your environment as you normally would for 
  # sinatra (using #content_type, #headers, etc). Finally, you complete your
  # response body by calling the #body method. This will push your body into the
  # response object, and call out to the server to actually send that data.
  #
  # == Example
  #  require 'sinatra/async'
  #  
  #  class AsyncTest < Sinatra::Base
  #    register Sinatra::Async
  #  
  #    aget '/' do
  #      body "hello async"
  #    end
  #  
  #    aget '/delay/:n' do |n|
  #      EM.add_timer(n.to_i) { body { "delayed for #{n} seconds" } }
  #    end
  #  
  #  end
  module Async
    # Similar to Sinatra::Base#get, but the block will be scheduled to run
    # during the next tick of the EventMachine reactor. In the meantime,
    # Thin will hold onto the client connection, awaiting a call to 
    # Async#body with the response.
